# To Whom It May Concern - Hello!

    This is another program to help me and others like me learn how to program in languages like C and C++.
    I thoroughly enjoy the simplicity that the C language is. I say that in complete ignorance of
    the overall scope of the entirety of the language itself and all of its functions. But regardless
    I do enjoy this language and programming in general and hope that someone can take away something
    from my source code on this project. Even if it's "I never want to code like this", that's totally
    fine with me.

    So a couple of things. If you enter characters where integers should be, expect for the program to
    crash. If you're here to learn but don't like anything I've done in this project please fork This
    this thing and change the code to whatever you feel is better and upload it to github. It would
    be a great learning mechanism for you.
